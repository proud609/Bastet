After reading the following vulnerability knowledge and understanding correct and incorrect examples, detect the problem in the contract code.\n\n### Vulnerability Knowledge\n\n**Unbounded loop**\nDoS (Denial of Service) in Solidity is a common type of vulnerability that is achieved by exhausting resources or blocking the operation of the contract, making it impossible to execute functions as expected.\nIn the blockchain world, program code is the implementation of the flow of funds or the execution of internal logic. In severe cases, DoS may directly cause assets or funds to become bricked, thereby directly causing losses to users or protocols.\n\n*What is Gas?\n\nA unit of measurement for the amount of computation required to perform an operation. Transaction operations in the blockchain, from simple transfers to complex contract interactions, all require gas.\n\n*Gas Limit\n\nIt is a mechanism that helps prevent infinite loops and other unexpected calculations from consuming all network resources and sets a maximum limit on the amount of gas that a smart contract can use.\nWhen the amount of gas used by a contract exceeds the gas limit, the contract execution stops, and any changes are reverted.\n\nIf the length of the deposits array is too long, the transaction cannot be completed due to excessive gas consumption, resulting in the failure of the withdrawal operation.\n\nAs the number of users increases, the length of the deposits array will continue to grow, which will cause general users to face higher gas fees when withdrawing funds, which may eventually lead to transaction failures or even the inability to withdraw their deposited funds.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example\n\nThe contract has a function for withdrawing funds from the deposit array.\n\n```solidity\nstruct Deposit {\n  address depositor;\n  uint256 amount;\n}\n\nDeposit[] public deposits;\n\nfunction deposit() public payable {\n  deposits.push(Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value));\n}\n\nfunction withdraw() public {\n  uint256 totalAmount = 0;\n  uint256 length = deposits.length;\n\n  for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n    if (deposits[i].depositor == msg.sender && deposits[i].amount > 0) {\n      uint256 amountToTransfer = deposits[i].amount;\n      deposits[i].amount = 0;\n\n      (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call {\n        value: amountToTransfer\n      }(\"\");\n      require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Suggestion**\n\nn/a\n\n### Task to Perform\nFollow the examples above to examine each contract and check if it contains this issue. If you find any potential issues, record them using the format below.\n\n### Output Format\n\nIf NO concrete vulnerability found, output exactly: **\"There’s no such issue.\"**\n\nOtherwise, follow the format below:\n\n```\n### Summary\nUnbounded loop\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n1. **File Name:** [Insert File Name\u001d, if input is not a file and cannot justify file name, leave blank]\n2. **Function Name(s):** [The functions where the issue occur]\n3. **Description:**\n[Describe vulnerability details]\n\n### Code Snippet\n[The lines where the vulnerability occurs]\n\n### Recommendation\n[Provide brief recommendations, do not need to mention Audit and Testing, do not need Code Snippet.]\n```",

After reading the following vulnerability knowledge and understanding correct and incorrect examples, detect the problem in the contract code.\n\n### Vulnerability Knowledge\n\n**Integration/Logical error**\nThis often happens when incorrect conditionals are used or external integration is not handled correctly, causing the contract functionality to be interrupted or unusable.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Logic Error vulnerability example\n\nThere is a function in the contract that can set a number.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^ 0.8 .0;\n\ncontract setNumber {\n  uint256 returnValue;\n\n  function setValue(uint256 _value) public {\n    require(address(this).balance <= 1 ether, \"Function cannot be used anymore due to high contract balance\");\n    returnValue = _value;\n  }\n\n  receive() external payable {}\n}\n```\n\nBecause the contract balance is used `address(this).balance <= 1` etheras the conditional, if there is an unexpected Ether sent, causing the contract balance to exceed 1 Ether, setValue() will be permanently blocked.\n\n#### Integration Error vulnerability example\n\nThere is a cross-chain settlement function in the contract.\n\n```solidity\n/**\n * @notice Settles claimed tokens to any valid Connext domain.\n * @dev permissions are not checked: call only after a valid claim is executed\n * @param _recipient: the address that will receive tokens\n * @param _recipientDomain: the domain of the address that will receive tokens\n * @param _amount: the amount of claims to settle\n */\nfunction _settleClaim(\n  address _beneficiary,\n  address _recipient,\n  uint32 _recipientDomain,\n  uint256 _amount\n) internal virtual {\n  bytes32 id;\n  if (_recipientDomain == 0 || _recipientDomain == domain) {\n    token.safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);\n  } else {\n    id = connext.xcall(\n      _recipientDomain, // destination domain\n      _recipient, // to\n      address(token), // asset\n      _recipient, // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage\n      _amount, // amount\n      0, // slippage -- assumes no pools on connext\n      bytes('') // calldata\n    );\n  }\n  emit CrosschainClaim(id, _beneficiary, _recipient, _recipientDomain, _amount);\n}\n```\n\n*What is Connext?\n\nConnext is a modular protocol for transferring funds and data between chains. Developers can use Connext to build cross-chain applications.\n\n*Use of xcall\n\nConnext's xcall is used to implement cross-chain calls, data transfer, and cross-chain asset transfer. When using xcall for cross-chain operations, two types of fees need to be paid to the off-chain agent , and the payment is made in native assets:\n- Router costs\n- Relayer Fees\n\nWhen using xcall, no relay fee is paid, resulting in the inability to complete cross-chain asset settlement. The claimed tokens will never be transferred to the beneficiary wallet on the target chain, and the cross-chain settlement function cannot function properly.\n\n**Suggestion**\n\nn/a\n\n### Task to Perform\nFollow the examples above to examine each contract and check if it contains this issue.

If an address is blacklisted, transfers to or from that address will be prohibited.\nA malicious or compromised token owner can trap funds in a contract by adding the contract address to a blacklist.\n\n*ERC777 tokens compatible with ERC20\nERC777 is compatible with ERC20. ERC777 implements tokensReceived through the ERC1820 registry.\nA malicious user could call tokensReceived and reject the token transfer, causing the transaction to fail and leaving the funds stranded.\n\nSince safeTransfer is used in the loop, if a recipient in recipients is blacklisted, or a user using ERC777 as a recipient implements revert in tokensReceived, the withdrawal process will be blocked. Even if other recipients are normal and legal users, they will not be able to receive the money they deserve.\n\n**Suggestion**\n\nn/a\n\n### Task to Perform\nFollow the examples above to examine each contract and check if it contains this issue.
